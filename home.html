    <h2>Early Life</h2>
<section id="early-text">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustin was born in 1912 in <em>West Chester, Pennsylvania,</em> <strong><abbr title=" National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</abbr></strong> leaders such as W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson were frequent guests in the Rustin home. With these influences in his early life Rustin was heavily influenced to campaign against racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws in his youth.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1932, Rustin entered Wilberforce College, a historically black college in Ohio operated by the AME Church. Rustin was active in a number of campus organizations, including the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was expelled from Wilberforce in 1936 after organizing a strike, and later attended Cheyney State Teachers College.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing an activist training program conducted by the American Friends Service Committee, Rustin moved to Harlem in 1937 and began studying at City College of New York. There he became involved in efforts to defend and free the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men in Alabama who were accused of raping two white women.</p>

    <h2>Homosexuality</h2>
    <img id="oip" src="OIP.jpg" alt="Bayard Rustin with Walter Naegle">
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustin was a gay man and, due to criticism over his sexuality, he usually acted as an influential adviser behind the scenes to civil-rights leaders. In the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay causes, speaking at events as an activist and supporter of human rights. <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s,said "I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality. That was rare in those days. Rare. "Rustin did not engage in any gay rights activism until the 1980s. He was urged to do so by his partner Walter Naegle, who has said that "I think that if I hadn't been in the office at that time, when these invitations came in, he probably wouldn't have done them." <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the lack of marriage equality at the time, Rustin and Naegle took the then not unusual step to solidify their partnership and protect their union legally through adoption: in 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time. <br><br> Rustin was arrested in Pasadena, California, in January 1953 for sexual activity with two men in their 20s, in a parked car. Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of "sex perversion" and served 60 days in jail.

    <h2>Civil Rights</h2>
    <img id="civ" src="civ.jpg" alt="Bayard Rustin and Cleveland Robinson">
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustin and Houser organized the Journey of Reconciliation in 1947. This was the first of the Freedom Rides to test the 1946 ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia that banned racial discrimination in interstate travel as unconstitutional.Participants in the Journey of Reconciliation were arrested several times. Rustin served twenty-two days on a chain gang in North Carolina for violating state Jim Crow laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustin served as an unidentified member of the American Friends Service Committee's task force to write "Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence", published in 1955. This was one of the most influential and widely commented upon pacifist essays in the United States. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rustin took leave from the War Resisters League in 1956 to advise minister Martin Luther King Jr. on Gandhian tactics. King was organizing the public transportation boycott in Montgomery, Alabama and according to Rustin, "I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns." Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection. <br> <br>

    <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustin died on August 24, 1987, of a perforated appendix. An obituary in The New York Times reported, "Looking back at his career, Mr. Rustin, a Quaker, once wrote: 'The principal factors which influenced my life are 1) nonviolent tactics; 2) constitutional means; 3) democratic procedures; 4) respect for human personality; 5) a belief that all people are one.'" Rustin was survived by Walter Naegle, his partner of ten years. President Ronald Reagan issued a statement on Rustin's death, praising his work for civil rights and "for human rights throughout the world". He added that Rustin "was denounced by former friends, because he never gave up his conviction that minorities in America could and would succeed based on their individual merit" <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rustin's tilt toward neo-conservatism in the late 1960s led him into a disagreement with most civil rights leaders. But, the 2003 documentary film Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin, a Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize nominee, and the March 2012 centennial of Rustin's birth have contributed to renewed recognition of his extensive contributions. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Daniel Richman, former clerk for United States Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, Marshall's friendship with Rustin, who was open about his homosexuality, played a significant role in Marshall's dissent from the court's 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of state sodomy laws in the later overturned 1986 case Bowers v. Hardwick.
